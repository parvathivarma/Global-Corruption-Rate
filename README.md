# Global-Corruption-Rate

## Motivation
After climate change and poverty, corruption is the next biggest issue faced all over the world. As a tax payer, I would like to see the amount I pay as tax being put to good use for the country's developement. When such expectations are not met and money that we pay as tax does not reach the right hands. This is really frusturating to see and experience. Hence, I chose this topic on world corruption rate to study its trend on a global level. 

## Objective
Objective of my visualization is to show a deceptive version on corruption around the world. The first version of my visualization talks about how average corruption has been increasing over the year and the second version contradicts the claim. It shows that though the percent of firms experiencing at least one bribe payment request during 6 transactions has been increasing, the number of such incidents has declined over the year. This visualization will give the government a clear picture of where their country stands in terms of corruption and a global perspective on countries that experience the highest corruption. 

## Intended Audience
Intended audience are officials in Anti-corruption agencies and bureau.  

## Data
I have taken the data from https://ourworldindata.org/corruption/ . Here is the link to the data source. 
<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/incidence-bribes-firms-2013?overlay=data&year=2010" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>
The first column of the data is entity which stands for names of different countries. The column 'code' refers to country code, year is recorded from 2006 to 2016 and Firm bribery incident (%) column refers to percent of firms experiencing at least one bribe payment request during 6 transactions.

## Claim 
Corruption is increasing over the year globally
The data has been sliced to show the recent 5 years data points. Data points from 2012 to 2016 is considered for this study.

### Description
I have chosen a bar graph to support my claim. The reason I chose bar graph is that it is easy to see the difference in height of the bar graph. 

#### Advantage 

Easy to notice the change over the year

#### Disadvantage

The year is not continuouse as it has to be. 

 ## My Final version of the claim

### Description
#### Why I choose this graph?

The line graph is a continuouse graph that can be easily interpreted by any reader. On viewing the graph, you can notice the trend easily.

#### Advantage

The graph is continuouse

It has marked data points so that the reader does not have to compare with the Y axis to get the value of increase/decrease

#### Disadvantage: 

A detailed graph stating the names of the countries where there is an increase in corruption would have been more helpful and impactful. 

## Deceptive version

### Claim

There is a decline in the rate of corruption at a global level.
