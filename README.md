# Global-Corruption-Rate

## Motivation
After climate change and poverty, corruption is the next biggest issue faced all over the world. As a tax payer, I would like to see the amount I pay as tax being put to good use for the country's developement. When such expectations are not met and money that we pay as tax does not reach the right hands. This is really frusturating to see and experience. Hence, I chose this topic on world corruption rate to study its trend on a global level. 

## Objective
Objective of this project is to show a deceptive version of a version of visualization I create on a particular topic. The first version of my visualization talks about how average corruption has been increasing over the year and the second version contradicts the claim. It shows that though the percent of firms experiencing at least one bribe payment request during 6 transactions has been increasing, the number of such incidents has declined over the year. This visualization will give the government a clear picture of where their country stands in terms of corruption and a global perspective on countries that experience the highest corruption. 

## Intended Audience
Intended audience are officials in Anti-corruption agencies and bureau.  

### Actions of Audience
Intended audience can work on making the systems more transparent. They can enforce strict punishments on violation of the rules in countries where there is no improvement. 

## Data
I have taken the data from https://ourworldindata.org/corruption/ . Here is the link to the data source. 
<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/incidence-bribes-firms-2013?overlay=data&year=2010" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>
The first column of the data is entity which stands for names of different countries. The column 'code' refers to country code, year is recorded from 2006 to 2016 and Firm bribery incident (%) column refers to percent of firms experiencing at least one bribe payment request during 6 transactions.

## Claim 
Corruption is increasing over the year globally
The data has been sliced to show the recent 5 years data points. Data points from 2012 to 2016 is considered for this study.

### Description
I have chosen a bar graph to support my claim. The reason I chose bar graph is that it is easy to see the difference in height of the bar graph. 

#### Advantage 

Easy to notice the change over the year

#### Disadvantage

The year is not continuouse as it has to be.

### Warrant

 ## My Final version of the claim
<img width="953" alt="screen shot 2017-11-17 at 10 22 42 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32216143/32972805-1577056a-cba9-11e7-95e7-e489997f737c.png">

### Description
#### Why I choose this graph?

The line graph is a continuouse graph that can be easily interpreted by any reader. On viewing the graph, you can notice the trend easily.

#### Advantage

The graph is continuouse

It has marked data points so that the reader does not have to compare with the Y axis to get the value of increase/decrease

#### Disadvantage: 

A detailed graph stating the names of the countries where there is an increase in corruption would have been more helpful and impactful. 

## Deceptive version

## Claim

There is a decline in the rate of corruption at a global level.

## Prototype 1 (Deceptive version)

<img width="737" alt="screen shot 2017-11-17 at 3 27 38 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32216143/32973401-0e2348a2-cbac-11e7-811b-71eac940d6b7.png">

#### Advantage

The advantage is that the graph shows the decline in a way that a reader can easily understand. 

#### Disadvantage

It does not have data points marked.

It does not show the reason behind the decline and hence not able to strongly oppose the claim that we made first. 

## Prototype 2 (Deceptive version)

<img width="737" alt="screen shot 2017-11-17 at 3 35 38 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32216143/32973572-1043e8ca-cbad-11e7-82d7-30f5c33f0b48.png">

#### Advantage

The graph uses the same metrics that is used in claim 1 and hence easier to compare.

#### Disadvantage

The graph does not indicate a steep decline which can make the readers think that 2016 was just an anomaly. 

## My Final Version of Claim 

<img width="894" alt="screen shot 2017-11-17 at 3 39 58 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32216143/32973662-b0bf42cc-cbad-11e7-85f9-7908b458fcf2.png">

### Description
#### Why I choose this visualization?
The first line graph is easy to understand and conveys the fact that number of bribery incidents have been declining over the year. 

The second graph supports the first graph by showing the number of countries that has reported incidents and we can clearly see that in the year 2016, only three incidents were reported. Out of the three incidents, the average percentage of bribery incident at Cambodia is very high which has resulted in higher value shown in the first graph. 

#### Advantage

The line graph gives a clear picture of decline of corruption rate 

The numbers on the point indicate the number of incidents

The second graph shows the percent bribery incidence per firm and hence gives us a clear picture at a country level

#### Disadvantage

There is a lot of color in the second graph which could have been avoided

The above article talks about the decline in corruption rate in India. 
India was ranked on top being one of the most corrupt Asian Country. A decline in corruption in such a country could show some improvement.  

## Future enhancement Roadmap

Understand the reason for such huge corruption in the year 2013

Analyze the effeciency of transparency system and relate it to the number of incidence reported

Correlate economic growth of a country with the incidence of corruption in that country
