# Global-Corruption-Rate

# Motivation
After climate change and poverty, corruption is the next biggest issue faced all over the world. As a tax payer, I would like to see the amount I pay as tax being put to good use for the country's developement. When such expectations are not met and money that we pay as tax does not reach the right hands. This is really frusturating to see and experience. Hence, I chose this topic on world corruption rate to study its trend on a global level. 

# Objective
Objective of my visualization is to show a deceptive version on corruption around the world. The first version of my visualization talks about how average corruption has been increasing over the year and the second version contradicts the claim. It shows that though the percent of firms experiencing at least one bribe payment request during 6 transactions has been increasing, the number of such incidents has declined over the year. This visualization will give the government a clear picture of where their country stands in terms of corruption and a global perspective on countries that experience the highest corruption.
